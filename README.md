# Molong = moran + zrlong + snow
- This scheme is largely based on the awesome [rime-moran (魔然)](https://github.com/ksqsf/rime-moran). You should check it out if you haven't.
- [rime-moran's wiki](https://github.com/ksqsf/rime-moran/wiki) in its entirety should be applicable to Molong. I will be handling this project with a very lean doc. Feel free to discuss by opening PR or raising issues. Reading comments on codes is a good alternative too. You can also join Moran's group chat to seek help.
- All the Double Pinyin (Shuangpin) codes in rime-moran have been replaced with [zrlong's Shuangpin scheme (自然龙)](https://github.com/Elflare/rime-zrlong). If you want to use Ziranma's Shuangpin scheme, you can use the OG rime-moran as linked above.
- The human-curated, one of the largest words/sentences library for Chinese language, [rime-snow (冰雪拼音)](https://github.com/hanzi-chai/rime-snow-pinyin), is bolted onto this repo, providing a seamless input experience with the ease of typing.

# Additional Features
- `ocz` = reverse lookup with Radical + Components, for example, `犇` = `牛牛牛` = `nmnmnm`. This function is based on [汉字拆字字典](https://github.com/mirtlecn/chaizi-re)
